				<h3> Unsurpassed Experience in Group Insurance Trusts & Dry Trusts </h3>
				<p>SentryCorp, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1995 by insurance professionals Georgia H. Massey and the late Virginia "Ginny" Alexander. The company was created to respond to the wishes of our clients to have their group insurance trusts handled by a company that truly understood the principles of being a group insurance trust trustee.
					<br />
					<br/>
				Over the years, our business has successfully grown because we have stayed true to our sole purpose: acting as a trustee for various group life, health and annuity insurance trusts known as dry trusts. </p>

				<h4>Multi-Employer and Group Insurance Trusts â€” Our Only Business</h4>

				<br/>
				<br/>
				Instead, our entire business is focused on providing you with the most experience in the area of multiemployer and group insurance trustee services, at low cost.</p>
